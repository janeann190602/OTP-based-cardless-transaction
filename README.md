# OTP-based-cardless-transaction

The goal of this project is to provide account holders with secure ATM transactions. The ATM takes a picture of the user's face and looks it up in the bank's database as the first stage in authentication. The second level of authentication generates an OTP for non-account holders. The remainder of the transaction can only be completed by authorized users, and email is used to communicate the transaction's specifics.
This project is developed fully using python and machine learning algorithms.
For executing the python file, use anaconda IDE.
